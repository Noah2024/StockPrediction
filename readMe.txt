General Notes:

Morning and Evening Run are scedhuled to run 5 minutes after and 5 minutes before the open and end of markets respectivley
This is becuase they should only run if the markets were open that day, and I can only get data from every 5 minute interval

In the systemMetaData the limit for API calls are represented as "alphaVanLimit": "25 - 1440", the first number being the
Total number of API calls that can be made, and the number after is how many MINUTES it takes for that number to reset
